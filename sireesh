David Berman (1967â€“2019) was an American musician, singer and poet. In 1989, with Pavement's Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich, he founded the indie-rock band Silver Jews, and was its only constant member until its dissolution in 2009. He provided the band's characteristic lyrics and the simple country-rock sound they developed from their early lo-fi recordings. His abstract, autobiographical lyrics were his creative priority, and he extensively labored over them. Despite believing his work was unappreciated, Berman cultivated a passionate following and became an influential figure in indie rock. After he announced his withdrawal from music in 2009, his return to music in 2019, under the moniker Purple Mountains, prompted an enthusiastic response. His return to music closely preceded his death. Berman's life was marred by difficulties; his music and poetry showcase a forlorn quality, using varied characters in eccentric and surreal circumstances.
